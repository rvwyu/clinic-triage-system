Clinic Pre-Triage System

A C++ object-oriented console application that simulates patient registration and admission in a healthcare clinic.

---

## Overview

This system tracks incoming patients, assigns tickets, calculates estimated wait times, and handles their admission for either contagion tests or triage services.

---

## Key Features

- **OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic memory, abstract interfaces
- **Patient Types:** `TestPatient` (Contagion) and `TriagePatient`
- **Ticketing System:** Tracks arrival time, number, and formats output
- **Menu System:** Text-based UI using `Menu` class
- **Persistence:** Loads/saves patients and wait times from CSV files
